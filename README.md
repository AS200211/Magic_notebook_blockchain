# 🧠 Magic Notebook Blockchain Game

A beginner-friendly blockchain simulation game built in Python to help understand key blockchain concepts interactively — like blocks, transactions, hashes, mining, and proof of work.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulate a blockchain ledger with blocks and hashes
- Add your own transactions (just like writing on a notebook page)
- Solve a proof-of-work puzzle to mine new blocks
- Watch blocks link together with SHA-256 hashes
- See how tampering with data breaks the chain

## 🧠 Concepts You’ll Learn

- Block structure
- SHA-256 hashing
- Proof of Work
- Chain linking
- Timestamps & immutability
- Why changing one block affects the entire chain

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries — uses only built-in modules (`hashlib`, `time`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the file:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/magic-notebook-blockchain.git
    cd magic-notebook-blockchain
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python magic_notebook_game.py
    ```

3. Follow the terminal menu to add transactions, mine blocks, and view your blockchain.
